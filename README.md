# Western Aero Design - Website

The main website for [Western Aero Design](https://westernaerodesign.com/), built using React and Tailwind.

### Getting started
```
git clone git@github.com:UWO-Aero-Design/westernaerodesign.com.git
cd westernaerodesign.com
npm i react-scripts
```

### Making Changes
Create a seperate branch to make changes on using ```git checkout -b branch-name```
Once you've made the desired changes, run ``` npm start ``` to run the website off your machine to preview the new changes. 

### Deploying
When you're ready to deploy your changes, run ```npm run deploy``` to create a build directory which is sent to the gh-pages branch and deployed to the live site. 
Deploying the website deploys what's on your machine, so be sure to push your changes to the repository and create a pull request to merge your branch with the master branch.
