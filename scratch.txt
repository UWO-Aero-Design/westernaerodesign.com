- Home page:
    (Purpose of page, this is really for outsiders who want to get a glance on what the team does, and be validated that the team is legit and actually does shit and compete, its the social proof, so keep that in mind)
    - Team Name and Logo so they immediately know
        - Western Aero Design (actually just don't do our logo, just say western aero design in purple)
            - Have our slogan sorta under it, and cool effects to it. (Design. Build. Fly.)
        - Have western engineering logo in there
        - Have a component that switches and says (We Build High Lift RC Planes), (We Build Delivery Drones) etc, where the We Build stays, but the other part changes in a cool effect.
    - Trailer Video
        - Have it be in the middle, make it easy to play
    - About Us
        - We are Western Aero Design
        - We compete annually in the SAE Aero Design competition
        - We are the premeir and pretty much only aerospace team in western university
        - We build planes, drones and VTOL aircraft
        - What sets us apart:
            - We are one of the few teams without an aerospace program, so we are fully self taught
    - Photo carousel
        - A carousel of candid and cool team photos that simple and elegant
        - When it reaches the end, it seemlessly goes to start like a ring (if it shows 4 photos at a time, [7, 8, 9, 10] transitions to [8, 9, 10, 0], to [9, 10, 0, 1])
    - Sponsor Logos
        - Add the sponsor with tiers component down here
        - When you hover over a sponsor's logo, it brings down a description of what they do and also has link to their website
        

- Team page:
    - (Purpose of page, The team page exists to clearly establish and legitimize the leadership structure, showing who drives the team’s mission forward. It celebrates the contributions of all members, reinforcing a sense of pride, belonging, and aspiration within the team. Externally, it projects professionalism and unity—inviting sponsors, faculty, and future recruits to see the team as credible, mission-driven, and worth supporting.)
    - (Purpose of page 2, Show who's in charge, what roles exist and how responsibility is structured)
    - Current team leads
            Organize the structure like a heirachy, where the more senior the bigger the card
            Captain -> Technical Directors -> Senior Leads -> Junior Leads
            When you get under the technical directors, so senior and junior leads, they will be split into two sections
            advanced class and regular class, where each of the cards will be in their respective one
            when you hover over advanced or regular class bar it will like dropdown and give brief background on what each is about.
                Advanced class, desiging a autonmous VTOl aircraft which can deliver and pickup packages.
                Regular class, designing a 10-15 foot high lift rc plane.
        - Team captain

    - Its a vertical line with points on it, alternating on either side with photos and the text
    (team started in 1999, first compete in 2001), say team was active for X years, where x is a variable in the javascript that is from 1999, so it updates on its own)

Website requirements:
- The theme should be purple and white to reflect our university (Western University)
- The theme should be light
- The theme should not be the modern SaaS style websites, but clean, simple yet responsive and have every detail thoughout
- The website should be multi page and not a single page
- The website should be modular react/javascript, but only create seperate modules when it will be complex- Throughout, the website should feel responsive and interactive, so add hover effects on important things to access more detail
    - Do not overly split the code into multiple files, if the file has very little functionality
    - Do this with reason, but create files when the logic is different and its warrant. Just be aware of this and execute on it like a 10x facebook engineer.
- The website should be amazing on mobile
- Use custom css for custom animations and feel free to use it a lot
- Execute like a 10x facebook engineer, think in detail
